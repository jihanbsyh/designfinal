          <p class="bio"> For her final project in Jason Das' class, Design for Journalist I, Jihan reinvented her work in the New School Free Press entitled "Fashion on 5th". Curious on student's choices of outfits in The New School, Jihan didn't want to just only cover what students were wearing, but why they were wearing it. Each student that Jihan has interviewed is always asked to describe their style and explain how they got the outfit in the first place. Believing that what we wear can have a story behind it, Fashion on 5th seeks to explore the relationship between clothing and people.</p>
          <p> A zine of Fashion on 5th was also made for the purpose of the course. </p>
